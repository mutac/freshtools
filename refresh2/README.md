# Overview

This project contains two Freshbooks-oriented python libraries, each with different
intentions.

## `refresh2`

`refresh2` is a python client to the new Freshbooks REST API.  This client module
is currently incomplete, and the REST API itself is under active development, so
early adopters should be aware of this when using `refresh2`, as stability, at
this point, is not guaranteed.
